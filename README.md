# EPLDashboard

Due to my love for the English Premier League (EPL), I have made a React app for this EPL-inspired webpage. 

Frameworks and third-party applications used for building this app:
- React.js
- APIs (3 APIs were used - 2 for EPL scores and fixtures, 1 for football news)
- Bootstrap

Some of the things you can view in this app:
- Latest scores and news

- Table rankings for current and previous seasons
